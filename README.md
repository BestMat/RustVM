# RustVM

1. 8 Bit virtual machine

In the video, I'll be creating a 64-bit Virtual Machine in Rust. Leverage your Rust and CS Skills by following this series (not scripted). We will be handling Memory, Registers, Binary, Assembly and also try creating our own Assembly Language, and possibly a small C Compiler that compiles to our Assembly which can run on our own virtual machine.
